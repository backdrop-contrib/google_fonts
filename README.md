# Google Fonts

This module enables you to add Google Fonts to your site using the 
Google Font API.

It is a port to BackdropCMS of the Drupal project, version 7.x-2.3.

This latest release 1.x-2.1.3 of the module for Backdrop CMS adds 
an administrative setting for the Google Webfonts API Key which is 
needed for fetching an up-to-date listing of all available Google fonts.

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at 
https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

Visit the configuration page at 
Administration > Configuration > System > Google Fonts 
(admin/config/system/google_fonts) 
and enter the required information.

## Issues
Bugs and Feature requests should be reported in the Issue Queue:
https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/google_fonts/issues.

Please note that when fetching the listing of all available 
Google fonts this module stores the information in its config
file which then becomes large, nearly 900 kilobytes.
