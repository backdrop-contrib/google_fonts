# Google Fonts

This module enables you to add Google Fonts to your site using the 
Google Font API.

It is a port to BackdropCMS of the Drupal project, version 7.x-2.3.

Note that the author now recommends adopting the more general 
@font-your-face module that not only support Google Fonts, 
but also several other font providers and combines all those fonts 
in a very user-friendly interface. 


## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at 
https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

Visit the configuration page at 
Administration > Configuration > Category >  Google Fonts 
(admin/config/category/google_fonts) 
and enter the required information.
